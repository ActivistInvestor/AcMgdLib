The files in this folder provide a means to count block references in
an AutoCAD DWG file. 

The code was designed to align with the results 
displayed by AutoCAD's COUNT palette.

Known issues that have been addressed in the latest commit:

1.  Blocks that are part of parameterized arrays within
    dynamic blocks were not counted correctly.

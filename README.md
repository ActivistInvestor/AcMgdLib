# AcMgdLib
Extension Library for managed AutoCAD.NET development

This library merges various components that were previously distributed
separately in various repositories, including parts of AcMgdUtility, 
AcDbLinq, and RibbonSupport into a single codebase, mainly because all 
of the above are dependent on the same set of common supporting code.

Additional components will be added regulary as they are documented.

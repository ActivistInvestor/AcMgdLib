# AcMgdLib
Extension Library for managed AutoCAD.NET development

This library merges parts of AcMgdUtility, with AcDbLinq, and RibbonSupport 
into a single codebase, mainly because all of the above are dependent on the
same common supporting code.

Additional components will be added regulary as they are documented.
